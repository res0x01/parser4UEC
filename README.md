# Scrape Landingpage

## How to use it

1. Get the webpage (you can curl, make a python script, or save the html page through your brower.  I intentionally didn't include a script to do it. DIY)
2. Change the `input_filename` variable in `scrape_landing.py` to the name of the file you saved in step 1.
3. Run `python scrape_landing.py`.
